# Hometasks on mathematical logic course
## Invocation
* __Hometask №1__
  
  Download all the files, compile them and then invoke Main.class with two arguments: paths to input and output files.
  
  `java Main <input> <output>`

* __Hometask №2__

  Hopefully, you will need to download only the [HW2.jar](./artifacts/HW2.jar) file and invoke it with 
  two arguments, same as in the previous case.
  
  `java -jar HW2.jar <input> <output>`
